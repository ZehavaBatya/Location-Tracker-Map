# Location-Tracker-Map
An interactive map that displays key figures/facts that are customizable annd visually appealing for the eye. Information, data, and map coordinates are shown as a way of conveying an interactive mapping. The company rockstars theme is as a result of knowing which team members are based where in terms of where they specialize in geographically for organizational and business purposes.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Netlify

I generated my own Google API key to implement a map packed with geographic locations, such as names of towns, cities, states, and countries. Please note, for security reasons, I have privated a portion of my code to prevent unforeseen hackers. With exact longitude and latitude coordinates, I created a marker of my choice. The red arrow signifies where, as my example shows, a professional named Mario targeting Chicago for his prospective clients. The marker is clickable as well as the marker being able to be animated when you refresh the page in an element function. 

## Optimizations

I started with a basic layout, but then I created the company logo colors of different shades of blue between light blues and darker ones. I removed Google's options for shopping stores to test customizability since the company focused more on institutions, rather than convenience stores. I've also made sure that my files are fully set on GitHub. Future optimizations can be a lengthier description, more markers, and a different marker shape. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned about Google APIs, Google keys, and how to leverage one of the largest tech companies in the world who kindly offer these tools publicly to be used. I learned Netlify and how to host my website too. The ability to condense my code as much as possible is step up from writing pseudo code or code that does not work. My progress is surely showing.
